# -NeuroYOLO-Brain-Tumor-Classification-and-Segmentation-

# 📖 Overview

This project integrates brain tumor segmentation and tumor type classification into a single unified pipeline using YOLO-based deep learning models.

YOLOv9 is used for precise tumor segmentation, identifying the tumor region in MRI scans.

YOLOv11 is used for tumor classification, categorizing the detected tumor into specific types (e.g., glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor).

This project aims to build a fast, accurate, and real-time diagnostic system for assisting radiologists in early tumor detection.
